# Frontend test

The app provides the options to search and filter the spaceship list.

Added a video to the folder.

I chose to use the Mantine UI for speed of development, I usually prefer to create my own toolchains whenever possible. I chose react router for the query params. I did not need any special state management solution.

## Getting started

I used vite and bun, project should work with the package manager of your likings.

[vite + bun](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/vite) \
[biome linter and formatter](https://biomejs.dev/guides/getting-started/)

```shell
bun dev
```
